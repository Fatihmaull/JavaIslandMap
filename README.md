# Java Island Map Project

## Overview
The Java Island Map Project is a Java-based application that visualizes the map of Java Island and its surrounding areas. It incorporates Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between different locations on the map.

## Key Features
- **Map Visualization**: Displays a detailed map of Java Island and its surroundings.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest paths between various points on the map.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to select start and end points to calculate and display the shortest route.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## Usage
1. **Map Display**: The application presents an interactive map of Java Island.
2. **Select Points**: Users can choose starting and ending points on the map.
3. **Shortest Path**: The application calculates and highlights the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
